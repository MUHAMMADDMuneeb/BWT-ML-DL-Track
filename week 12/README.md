## Data Description and Importance of Microaneurysms Detection<br>
Microaneurysms Detection in Diabetic Retinopathy: Microaneurysms are the earliest visible signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness in diabetic patients. These small, round, red spots on the retina result from capillary wall outpouching and are critical indicators for the early diagnosis of DR. Detecting microaneurysms at an early stage allows for timely intervention, which can prevent the progression of DR and ultimately save a patient's vision.<br>
